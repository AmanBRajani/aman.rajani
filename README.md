# 🚀 Aman Rajani – Personal Portfolio

## 👋 About the Project

A sleek, high-performance **developer portfolio** built with **React + TailwindCSS**, focused on showcasing my expertise in **AI** and **Web Development**.

This site is more than just a portfolio — it’s a personal brand, a resume, and a live demo of the kind of creative, scalable, and intelligent interfaces I love building.
